# Flow Summary
1 User clicks the Facebook or Google login button on index.html.
2 The JavaScript function redirects the user to /auth/facebook or /auth/google.
3 The respective route initiates the Passport authentication flow.
4 The user is redirected to Facebook or Google to log in.
5 Upon successful login, Facebook or Google redirects the user back to the callback URL (/auth/facebook/callback or /auth/google/callback).
6 Passport processes the callback, retrieves the user profile, and stores the login information.
7 If authentication is successful, the user is redirected to /auth/protected where their information is displayed.
8 If authentication fails, the user is redirected to /auth/failure.
